# Portfolio Project

Access my personal portfolio containing everything needed for an application. This includes a visual and written representation of me (video, photo, & bio) with links to my Github, LinkedIn, and other socials. The portfolio also contains direct links to project repositories.

## Roadmap for Improvements

- Revamp the background design to be more personal and dynamic on multiple screen sizes/aspect ratios.
- Replace project links with more recent projects and add more.
- Consider replacing headshots.
